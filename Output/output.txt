[OK]   Length after 5 pushes is 5
[OK]   Stack becomes full at capacity
[OK]   Caught overflow: push(): Stack is full
[OK]   Peek returns top element (5)

[OK]   Copy has same length
[OK]   B top becomes 3 after pop

C (assigned from A) [top->bottom] (len=4/5): 4 3 2 1
[OK]   Assigned stack has same length
[OK]   Self-assignment leaves stack intact
B after clear() [top->bottom] (len=0/0): <empty>
[OK]   Cleared stack is empty
[OK]   Caught underflow (pop): pop(): Stack is empty
[OK]   Caught underflow (peek): peek(): Stack is empty
[OK]   Top is 20
